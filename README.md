This NestJs package makes it easy to add early access mode to your existing application. This is useful when you want to launch a product and need to gather the email addresses of people who want early access or want to stay on the waiting list of the application.

## Usage  
  
### Installation  
```bash  
npm install nestjs-early-access  
``` 
###  EarlyAccessModule  
This EarlyAccessModule is the core of the package, it serves as the main entry point and can be used in both synchronous and asynchronous manner.    
Simple import the `EarlyAccessModule` into your application.  
  
#### Synchonous Mode  
Simple call the `forRoot` method on the synchronous mode.  
  ```bash 
 EarlyAccessModule.forRoot({        
				 enabled: true    
		    })    
 export class AppModule {}  
``` 

  #### Asynchronous Mode  
   ```bash
 EarlyAccessModule.registerAsync({      inject: [EarlyAccessService],    
      imports: [ServiceModule],    
      useFactory: (earlyAccessService: EarlyAccessService) => ({    
          repository: earlyAccessService,    
          enabled: true,    
      }),    
    })    

  export class AppModule {}  
   ```    
   
### Using Default Template
Nest Js provides you to easily just add the information on your early access page using the default template if you wish.
Simple provide the options object with `defaultTemplate` of type.  Remember that you can do this in synchronous and asynchronous mode.
   ```bash
     EarlyAccessModule.registerAsync({  
          inject: [EarlyAccessService],  
	      imports: [ServiceModule],  
	      useFactory: (earlyAccessService: EarlyAccessService) => {  
            return {  
              repository: earlyAccessService,  
		      enabled: true,  
		      url: '/',  
		      defaultTemplate: {  
	               assetsDir: `${process.cwd()}/assets`,  
				    productName: 'Aso Books',  
				    logo: {  
		                 type: 'img',  
					     source: `/logo.svg`,  
						 },  
			      submitButton: {  
		                  color: '#5661b3',  
					      text: 'Join waiting list',  
				      },  
			      placeHolderImage: `/undraw_all_the_data_h4ki.svg`,  
			      welcomeMessage: {  
		                  text: 'Welcome to early access',  
					      color: '#5661b3',  
					      sub: 'You can type any thing you like to write as a sub welcome message. Do not forget to start this though.',  
				      },  
				},  
			 };  
		   },  
	    }),  
	   ],  
      controllers: [AppController],  
      providers: [AppService],  
    })  
    export class AppModule {  
    }
   ```
   
### Using Custom Assets  
You can also decide to use custom assets if you wish, although early access provides a default one out of the box for you.  If you provide a template early-access will use the provided template instead.  
   ```bash
 EarlyAccessModule.forRoot({        enabled: false,    
       template: {    
            viewDir: `${process.cwd()}/views`,    
          assetsDir: `${process.cwd()}/assets`,    
          index: 'index',    
      }    
    })    
    export class AppModule {    
        
    }  
   ```
### API SPEC  
| property            | type                  | description                                                                                                       |  
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| enabled             | boolean               | This will activate early access when set to true and will set to false when otherwise.                           |  
| URL                 | string                | This is the URL to use to access the early access page this defaults to "/early-access"                           |  
| twitterHandle       | string                | This is the twitter handle of your products                                                                       |  
| template            | Object                | This is the custom template you might wish to render if you do not want to use the default template.             |  
| template.viewDir    | string                | This is the directory of your custom views                                                                        |  
| template.assetsDir  | string                | This is the directory of the assets of your custom view.                                                          |  
| template.index      | string                | This is the file that will be rendered. At this time early access uses .ejs.                                       |  
| twitterShareMessage | string                | This is the message you will like to share on twitter when your user clicks share on twitter.                     |  
| repository          | EarlyAccessRepository | This is the repository you will like to use to persist the subscribers as well as removed the subscribers |  
  
  ### Providing the early access URL  
  If you want to provide a custom URL. Provide `URL` in the forRoot object.  
  
### EarlyAccessRepository  
The `nestjs-early-access` uses an in-memory storage to persist. You should provide your repository to persist subscribers as well as remove subscribers.  
  
## Todos  
- Provide a notification class or an event. So that this can be implemented or subscribed to when a subscriber is created or removed.  
- Improve on read me.
- Write better test
